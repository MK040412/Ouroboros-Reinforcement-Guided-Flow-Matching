## Abstract

Current text to image diffusion models still struggle to follow complex and
compositional prompts, largely due to the absence of consistent signals
throughout the denoising trajectory. We introduce OUROBOROS, a
reinforcement guided flow matching framework that unifies critic optimiza
tion and generative diffusion in latent space. Inspired by ControlNet style
conditioning, our method incorporates a critic network that evaluates
intermediate denoising steps via cross attention, producing reinforcement
based rewards for each latent update. These reward signals are used to
iteratively refine the flow trajectory, enabling robust alignment between
text and image over long horizon, sparse reward scenarios. To stabilize
representation transitions across steps, we employ cross domain module
inspired by control net and cycle gan, ensuring dimension consistency
and cyclic regularization between encoder–decoder flows. We expect that
framework achieves scalable, bi directional optimization that dynamically
corrects latent paths while maintaining generation diversity.
